    "Each Himawari image is composed of 160 binary files, and these files are not instantly loaded into the AWS Bucket. Therefore, we need to run the main function several times within a short period to download all 160 files (or all 10 files for each channel). The issue arises when we run the function once in the notebook, as no new files will be downloaded in subsequent runs. However, this issue does not exist when running the provided Python module alongside this notebook with the same name. Therefore, it was decided to periodically run the `Himawari_Download.py` from the notebook (e.g., every 30 seconds) until all files are downloaded. Because this process takes about 4 to 5 minutes, the feature to run in the background was also added.\n",
